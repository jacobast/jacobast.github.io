            <h2>üìå Project Overview - From Functional to Fantastic</h2>
            <p>LABB is a ticket-selling platform for students by students, designed to streamline event management in Lund's student community. While the system worked, usability testing revealed several roadblocks - especially for event organizers.</p>
            <p>The consumer side was fairly intuitive with only minor frustrations, like the lack of search and filtering. But the organizer's side? A different story. Confusing workflows, poorly explained features and tedious manual inputs made event creation more frustrating than it needed to be.</p>
            <p>That's where I came in. My mission? Redesigning LABB from the ground up - enhancing usability, modernizing the interface and making event management a smoother experience for both consumers and organizers.</p>

            <h2>‚ö†Ô∏è The Problem - A Platform That Works, But Not Seamlessly</h2>
            <p>LABB had the potential to be an essential tool for student events, but usability issues made it harder to use than it should be.</p>
            <p>üìâ Consumer Frustrations - "Good, But Could Be Better"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No event search or filtering - Scrolling endlessly to find events wasn't ideal</li>
                <li>Clunky seat selection - Selecting seats on the small map was frustrating</li>
                <li>Unclear ticket process - Users wanted to choose ticket type first, not after selecting seats</li>
                <li>"Add to Cart" step felt unnecessary - Buying tickets should be fast, not multi-stepped</li>
                <li>Hard to find purchased tickets - Users expected a clearer way to access them</li>
            </ul>
            <p>üòµ Organizer Struggles - "Where Do I Even Start?"</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Too many repetitive inputs - Entering dates multiple times for events & tickets was frustrating</li>
                <li>Confusing event location setup - Users had to create locations before making an event, causing lost progress</li>
                <li>Vague labels & options - Terms like "Min-price" and "Responsible User" weren't clear</li>
                <li>No ticket add-ons - Organizers wanted the ability to include extras</li>
                <li>Missing banner guidelines - No instructions on image size led to frustrating trial and error</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These issues slowed down both consumers and organizers, making the platform harder to use than necessary.</p>

            <h2>üé® Design Process - A Complete Overhaul in Progress</h2>
            <p>Since the original LABB design was focused on functionality rather than aesthetics, this is a full-scale redesign.</p>
            <ol class="custom-steps">
                <li>Usability Testing - I gathered real user feedback to pinpoint the biggest pain points</li>
                <li>Visual Refresh - New icons, colors, and typography to create a more refined look</li>
                <li>UX Enhancements - Streamlining event creation, improving ticket selection, and making navigation smoother</li>
                <li>Interactive Prototyping - Building new workflows in Figma for testing before development</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Biggest challenge? Doing all this as a solo designer - with a long to-do list!</p>

        <section>
            <h2>‚úÖ The Solution - LABB 2.0 is Coming!</h2>
            <p>While the redesign is still in progress, here's what's coming:</p>
            <p>‚ú® For Consumers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Better event discovery - Search & filter functions</li>
                <li>Simplified ticket purchasing - More intuitive selection flow</li>
                <li>Cleaner interface & improved readability - A refreshed, modern look</li>
            </ul>
            <p>‚öôÔ∏è For Organizers:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Smarter date selection - Autofill and preset options to reduce manual input</li>
                <li>More intuitive event creation - Creating locations won't interrupt the process</li>
                <li>Clearer instructions & labels - No more guessing what "Min-price" means</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>üöÄ What's next?</strong> <br> So far, only the new colors and logo have been implemented, but the Figma redesign is underway. Once testing begins, I'll refine the designs based on feedback - making LABB smoother, smarter, and more user-friendly than ever!</p>
